### 🖐️ Hand Gesture Detection

Developed a lightweight spatiotemporal model using PyTorch to classify user hand gestures in real-time, enabling automatic feedback on whether users followed motor task instructions correctly. 

The model was deployed in a web-based cognitive testing platform and evaluated in a real-world study.
